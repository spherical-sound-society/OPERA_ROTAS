For the 1.1/1.2/1.6 pangrus edition the keyboard shorcuts are:

REC - start/stop. The ">" sign in the upper left appears when the OR sequencer is running.
AUTO - engage AUTO mode. In AUTO mode, the active channel changes every step. When you move a knob, the correspondig parameter of the active channel is affected.
AUTO + Pressing the keys from 1 to 8 load the sound presets
LOCK - engage LOCK mode. Pressing the keys from 1-8 the corresponding channel toggles from locked to unocked.
EDIT - engage EDIT mode. Press the keys 1-16 to edit the active pattern. The pattern is shown on the leds.
CHAN - engage CLEAR mode. Pressing the keys from 1-8 clears the corresponding channel.
RND - engage RANDOM mode. Pressing the keys from 1-8 randomize the corresponding channel. Randomization is made with the euclidean algorithm.
SAVE - engage MUTE mode. Pressing the keys from 1-8 the corresponding channel toggles from muted to unmuted.
SHIFT + AUTO - toggles slave MIDI mode.
SHIFT + LOCK - locks all channels.
SHIFT + CHAN - clears all channels.
SHIFT + RND - Select generative mode. In GEN1 mode every 16 step the gates of one pattern and one sound parameters is randomized. In GEN2 mode gates are unchanged; every step one sound parameter is randomized. Bpm selection is disabled.
SHIFT + SAVE - mutes all channels.m machine you hear in the demos.

FROM 1.6 VERSION

midi mode select
press SHIFT + AUTO to engage midi slave mode now works only if a midi clock is present on the 1/8" MIDI IN connector.

 random euclidean pattern complexity is now selectable
Use the VIBRAZUM knob to control the number of hits of the rhythm pattern.
On the Opera Rotas screen the HIT parameter is displayed, ranging from 3 to 16.
The pattern complexity depends on this parameter, a value of 3 will produce sparse patterns.
This affects the GEN 1 mode as well as the RND mode.


ONLY IN THE 1.7 VERSION
when the machine is running and is not in clear/lock/random/mute mode, if you keep pressed the keys from 1 to 8 you get temporary patten variations.

Now the OR is always listening to MIDI notes, it means that you can trigger the 8 channels from a midi keyboard even if is not slaved to midi clock.
